# Informational Responses

100:
  message: "Continue"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK \
                and that the client should continue with the request or ignore \
                it if it is already finished."

101:
  message: "Switching Protocol"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header by \
                the client, and indicates the protocol the server is switching to."

  message: "Processing (WebDAV)"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "This code indicates that the server has received and is \
                processing the request, but no response is available yet."

103:
  message: "Early Hints / Checkpoint"
  category: "Informational Responses"
  description: "Early Hints
                This code indicates that the server is likely to send a final response with the\
                header fields included in that very informational response. It is intended to\
                minimize the perceived latency taking advantage of the Link header field to\
                speculatively preload or prefetch resources.

                Checkpoint
                This code is the same as the 308 status code except for the fact that it is sent\
                as a provisional response rather than a final response.\
                In other words, zero or more 103 responses can be sent in response to a request\
                that is still being processed, after which a final response code must be sent."

# Successful Responses

200:
  message: "OK"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The request has succeeded. The meaning of a success varies \
                depending on the HTTP method:
                GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the \
                message body.
                HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
                PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is \
                transmitted in the message body.
                TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received \
                by the server"

201:
  message: "Created"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as \
                a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a POST \
                request, or after some PUT requests."

202:
  message: "Accepted"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is \
                non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send \
                an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the \
                request. It is intended for cases where another process or server \
                handles the request, or for batch processing."

203:
  message: "Non-Authoritative Information"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "This response code means returned meta-information set is not \
                exact set as available from the origin server, but collected from \
                a local or a third party copy. Except this condition, 200 OK \
                response should be preferred instead of this response."

204:
  message: "No Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "There is no content to send for this request, but the headers \
                may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for \
                this resource with the new ones."

205:
  message: "Reset Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "This response code is sent after accomplishing request to tell \
                user agent reset document view which sent this request."

206:
  message: "Partial Content"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "This response code is used because of range header sent by the \
                client to separate download into multiple streams."

  message: "Multi-Status (WebDav)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "A Multi-Status response conveys information about multiple \
                resources in situations where multiple status codes might be \
                appropriate."

208:
  message: "Multi-Status (WebDav)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "Used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating \
                the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection \
                repeatedly."

226:
  message: "IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding)"
  category: "Successful Responses"
  description: "The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the \
                response is a representation of the result of one or more \
                instance-manipulations applied to the current instance."

# Redirection Messages

300:
  message: "Multiple Choice"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "The request has more than one possible response. The user-agent \
                or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way \
                of choosing one of the responses."

301:
  message: "Moved Permanently"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This response code means that the URI of the requested resource \
                has been changed. Probably, the new URI would be given in the \
                response."

302:
  message: "Found"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This response code means that the URI of requested resource has \
                been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made \
                in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the \
                client in future requests."

303:
  message: "See Other"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "The server sent this response to direct the client to get the \
                requested resource at another URI with a GET request."

304:
  message: "Not Modified"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the \
                response has not been modified, so the client can continue to \
                use the same cached version of the response."

305:
  message: "Use Proxy"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "Was defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to \
                indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy. \
                It has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band \
                configuration of a proxy."

306:
  message: "Unused"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This response code is no longer used, it is just reserved \
                currently. It was used in a previous version of the HTTP 1.1 \
                specification."

307:
  message: "Temporary Redirect"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "The server sends this response to direct the client to get the \
                requested resource at another URI with same method that was used \
                in the prior request. This has the same semantics as the 302 Found \
                HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must \
                not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first \
                request, a POST must be used in the second request."

308:
  message: "Permanent Redirect"
  category: "Redirection Messages"
  description: "This means that the resource is now permanently located at another \
                URI, specified by the Location: HTTP Response header. This has \
                the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response \
                code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the \
                HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first request, a POST \
                must be used in the second request."

400:
  message: "Bad Request"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response means that server could not understand the request \
                due to invalid syntax."

401:
  message: "Unauthorized"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "Although the HTTP standard specifies 'unauthorized', semantically \
                this response means 'unauthenticated'. That is, the client must \
                authenticate itself to get the requested response."

402:
  message: "Payment Required"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response code is reserved for future use. Initial aim for \
                creating this code was using it for digital payment systems \
                however this is not used currently."

403:
  message: "Forbidden"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The client does not have access rights to the content, i.e. they \
                are unauthorized, so server is rejecting to give proper response. \
                Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server."

404:
  message: "Not Found"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The server can not find requested resource. In the browser, this \
                means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean \
                that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. \
                Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide the \
                existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response \
                code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent occurence \
                on the web."

405:
  message: "Method Not Allowed"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "The request method is known by the server but has been disabled \
                and cannot be used. For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a \
                resource. The two mandatory methods, GET and HEAD, must never be \
                disabled and should not return this error code."

406:
  message: "Not Acceptable"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response is sent when the web server, after performing \
                server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content \
                following the criteria given by the user agent."

  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This is similar to 401 but authentication is needed to be done \
                by a proxy."

408:
  message: "Request Timeout"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, \
                even without any previous request by the client. It means that \
                the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This \
                response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, \
                Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed \
                up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the \
                connection without sending this message."

409:
  message: "Conflict"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current \
                state of the server."

410:
  message: "Gone"
  category: "Client Error Responses"
  description: "This response would be sent when the requested content has been \
                permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. \
                Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the \
                resource. The HTTP specification intends this status code to be \
                used for 'limited-time, promotional services'. APIs should not \
                feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with \
                this status code."
